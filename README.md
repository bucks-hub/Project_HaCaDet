This is the initial python code for Project HacaDet developed for  my Master Thesis at BMW Regensburg on the topic "Detection of Interfering contours in the flow operation of an assembly line using Neural Networks".
The thesis topic was then later continued for improvements and then was renamed as HaCaDet - short form for Hanging Cable Detector.
